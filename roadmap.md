### ðŸš€ MVP Phase (London & South East Pilot)

âœ… **Core Goals**
- Click-to-analyze map with parcel detection  
- Density calculator (units per acre/hectare)  
- Zoning + constraint overlays (flood, conservation)  
- Output visual result and downloadable PDF  

ðŸ›  **Features**
- Upload parcel boundaries (GeoJSON) for selected boroughs  
- Enable Mapbox map in Bubble  
- Trigger backend workflow on map click  
- Return density, zoning type, constraint flags  
- Generate traffic-light style feasibility rating  
- Display results in panel + download as PDF

### ðŸ§  Phase 2 â€“ Data Enrichment

âœ… **Core Goals**
- Add more real-world data and logic  
- Improve credibility of feasibility insights  

ðŸ›  **Features**
- Integrate planning applications (local authority APIs or scrape)  
- Upload sales comps dataset (CSV or Supabase)  
- Include constraints: flood zones, AONBs, conservation areas  
- Build risk scoring model for development scenarios  
- Expand overlays (green belt, designations, contamination)  
- Begin regional scaling to additional high-demand areas
